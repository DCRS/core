This script triggers a build of the official Ubuntu Core snap package at:

https://code.launchpad.net/~snappy-dev/+snap/ubuntu-core

If you have a personal branch of lp:ubuntu-core-snap (using your own PPAs
during build for injecting test packages etc...), then please adjust the
variables at the top of lp-build-ubuntu-core to match your needed targets.
(do not forget to fix the mail receipients too)

There is an example crontab to show how the script should be invoked by cron

NOTE: you need to run this script at least once by hand to have launchpad
      create the necessary credentials for automated execution.
